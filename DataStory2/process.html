                <h2>Determining revision and new section</h2>

                <p>I wrote down all of the details that I want to revise in my data story. Please download the pdf to
                    see all the comments in Acrobat, since the browser version doesn't show the comment replies. </p>

                <p>To figure out what section I should add, I first listed out all the sections that my data story has
                    so far. I find that my data story is more focused on the production and envrionmental aspects of
                    rice, and lacks the cultural aspect, which is something that I can talk about.</p>

                <p>After the 1-on-1 meeting in week 2 do I realize that the transition between each section of the story
                    isn't really smooth. Hence I decided to reorder the sections first, and then for sections that I
                    can't figure out how to transition, I will add a new section to help bridge it.</p>

                <p>Due to the time constraints, I don't think I will be able to revise everything, hence I made a list
                    of what I should prioritize.</p>

                <h2>Timeline Redesign</h2>

                <p>I redesign the timeline because I think having the whole timeline fit on the broswer window would allow the viewer to understand the time span even better. In the original (verticle) timeline, the steps like step 2 (irrigation & growing) and step 3 (harvest) are cropped. </p>
