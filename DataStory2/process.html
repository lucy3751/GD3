                <h2>Determining revision and new section</h2>

                <p>I wrote down all of the details that I want to revise in my data story. Please download the pdf to
                    see all the comments in Acrobat, since the browser version doesn't show the comment replies. </p>

                <p>To figure out what section I should add, I first listed out all the sections that my data story has
                    so far. I find that my data story is more focused on the production and envrionmental aspects of
                    rice, and lacks the cultural aspect, which is something that I can talk about.</p>

                <p>After the 1-on-1 meeting in week 2 do I realize that the transition between each section of the story
                    isn't really smooth. Hence I decided to reorder the sections first, and then for sections that I
                    can't figure out how to transition, I will add a new section to help bridge it.</p>

                <p>Due to the time constraints, I don't think I will be able to revise everything, hence I made a list
                    of what I should prioritize.</p>

                <p>After recieving feedback from class meetings, the plan eventually became like this:</p>

                <h2>Transition of the Beginning Part</h2>

                <p>
                    To transition from the title to the different types of rice in the nutrition chart, I plan to talk about rice consumption in other countries first, and then introduce a common example of a rice dish that the top 5-10 countries consume. Through feedback during class, I learned that the rice dish varies in different regions of each country, so it is hard to pick a dish that is inclusive to the whole country. But the type of rice is usually the same for different rice dishes, hence I decided to focus on the common type of rice the countries consume. 
                    
                    For some of the countries, I wasn't able to find the specific type of rice they used. So I ended up focusing on the two classifications (Japonica and Indica) instead of the specific type (jasmine, basmati,...).

                <h2>Rediscovering Rice Classifications</h2>

                <p>
                    After Prof suggested me to see if white and brown rice is a parent category instead of a specific type of rice, I realized that the same thing goes for red rice and black rice. At the same time, black rice is not the same as wild rice. Wild rice comes from a totally different plant. No wonder the worldwide rice production map did not include Canada, even though wild rice was one of the important crops for the First Nations. I think it would have been great to talk about this in my data story if there was extra time.

                <h2>Production Timeline Redesign</h2>

                <p>I redesigned the timeline because I think having the whole timeline fit on the broswer window would allow the viewer to understand the time span even better. In the original (verticle) timeline, the steps like step 2 (irrigation & growing) and step 3 (harvest) are cropped. </p>

                <p>Prof suggested that I should explore using a Gantt chart for this, which it ended up being the final chart. I think Gantt charts showed the overlaps between the steps better than the timelines.</p>
