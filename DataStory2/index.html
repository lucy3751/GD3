        <p>Growing up as a Chinese, rice is something that I eat everyday. My typical daily meal consist of a bowl of steamed white rice, accompanied with three or four dishes - usually vegetables, meat, and fish. 
        <br>
        Despite eating rice everyday, I still donâ€™t actually know a lot about this food. Hence I decided to learn and share some of my findings about it.

    <!-- CLASSIFYING RICE-->
    <div class="parentDivs">
        <h2>CLASSIFYING RICE</h2>

        <p>In the visualization above, You will notice that there are two classifications: Japonica and Indica. Like its diverse consumers, rice is a very diverse food. The most commonly grown rice species, Oryza sativa, already contains more than 40,000 varieties (wikiCultivars). Japonica and Indica are the two major subspecies of Oryza sativa rice (wikiSativa). 
        <br>
        Japonica rice are usually short and medium-grain, while Indica rice are usually long-grain. Rice are starches, which contains amylose and amylopectin. Due to high amylopectin, which is water-soluble, Japonica rice are usually sticky when cooked. Indica rice on the other hand, has more amylose hence they don't stick together (SeriousEats). 
        <br>
        Besides these two classifications, we can also classify rice based on their grain color: red, brown, white, and black. This is most commonly used to classify grains outside of the Oryza sativa. And it is generally based on how the grains are processed.
        <br>
        Brown and white rice comes from the same plant. Most of the bran is kept in brown rice, while it is removed in white rice (SeriousEats). Red rice comes from a species different from Oryza sativa, and only the hull is removed (wikiRed). Black rice comes from a different variety as well, but it does not undergo any processing (foodNDTV). 
        <br>
        Here is a cross section showing the layers in a grain of rice:

        The bran of a rice grain contains most of the fiber (medicalNewsToday). Since black rice does not undergo any processing, it is able to retain the bran, hence have the most fiber out of the other colored grains. The hull of the rice grain is also retained, which makes black rice have high disease-fighting antioxidants (realeats). 
        <br>
        In Oryza sativa rice (the most common), the classifications (Japonica and Indica) also corresponds to the nutrients. Here is a comparison of some popular examples of Oryza sativa rice. All the examples are white grains.

        <p>Arborio, sticky, and calrose rice are classified as Japonica. As mentioned, generally speaking, Japonica rice are high in amylopectin, which result in the sticky texture when these rice are cooked. Because of this characteristic, Japonica rice are high in both sodium and sugar. They also have a high glycaemic index (healthyfood), which cause their carbohydrates to break down quickly, causing a rapid increase in blood-sugar levels (Nhs). 
        <br>    
        Surprisingly, in the visualization, only sticky rice has the highest sodium. Both arborio and calrose rice has no sodium. This might be because sticky rice is short-grain, while arborio and calrose are medium-grain (usually), or maybe the nutrition data varies for different brands of the rice.

        Despite being the top producer, China is also the top importer of rice. This may be due to the huge population and rice being the staple food. In 2020/2021, China is the top country in rice consumption*. We can see similar situation with India as well, which is the second in rice consumption*.
        <br>
        *Note: if we were to consider the rice consumption per capita, Bangladesh would be the top 1 country (see the first visualization in this data story).

    <!-- RICE PRODUCTION METHOD -->
    <div class="parentDivs">
        <h2>RICE PRODUCTION METHOD</h2>

        <p>
        With many countries producing rice, countries have developed their own production methods. But they can be organized into three main methods: irrigation, rainfed lowland, and rainfed upland.
        <br>
        For the irrigation method, the rice paddies are <a href=" https://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/where-is-rice-grown">flooded</a>. Since rice requires a lot of water to grow, this method is yields the most rice. Hence it is the most popular method, occupying <a href="https://www.cropin.com/blogs/sustainable-rice-practices-safeguarding-the-environment-sustaining-livelihoods/">54% of the global rice harvested area</a>, and responsible for <a href="https://www.cropin.com/blogs/sustainable-rice-practices-safeguarding-the-environment-sustaining-livelihoods/">75% of the global rice population</a>. <a href="https://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/where-is-rice-grown">40% of the global irrigation water and 30% of the freshwater resources</a> are used to grow irrigation rice.
        <br>
        For the rainfed lowland method, rice are grown near rivers so that it can be <a href="https://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/where-is-rice-grown">flooded with rainwater</a>. However, due to <a href="https://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/where-is-rice-grown">occasional drought periods, it doesn't produce that much rice</a>. This method occupies <a href="https://www.cropin.com/blogs/sustainable-rice-practices-safeguarding-the-environment-sustaining-livelihoods/">30% of the global rice harvested area</a> and is responsible for <a href="https://www.cropin.com/blogs/sustainable-rice-practices-safeguarding-the-environment-sustaining-livelihoods/">20% of the global rice population</a>.
        <br>
        For the rainfed upland method, rice is grown without irrigation and flooding. It is similar to growing wheat. Since the soil conditions are very unstable (sometimes highly fertile to infertile), it doesn't yield that much rice as well. Hence this method occupies only <a href="https://www.cropin.com/blogs/sustainable-rice-practices-safeguarding-the-environment-sustaining-livelihoods/">7% of the global rice harvested area</a> and is responsible for only <a href="https://www.cropin.com/blogs/sustainable-rice-practices-safeguarding-the-environment-sustaining-livelihoods/">1% of the global rice population</a>.
        <br>
        As mentioned, the production method varies by country. Here is an example of how rice is produced in the United States. The months for each step shown in the visualization vary in different countries, due to vary climate seasons.

    <!-- RICE PRODUCES METHANE -->
    <div class="parentDivs">
        <h2>RICE PRODUCES METHANE</h2>

        <p>Surprisingly, rice is also a source of methane emission. Since it is a global staple food, rice is the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food">crop that produces the most methane </a>.
        <br>
        Rice is grown by flooding the rice fields/paddies, the <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/12/07/can-grow-climate-friendly-rice/">water blocks the soil from oxygen, which creates microorganisms in the soil that produces methane</a>. The longer the rice paddies are being flooded, the more microorganisms are created, and more methane is produced. Here is the worldwide rice methane emission in 2019:
        </p>

        </div>
        <!-- end of rice production chart vs methane production chart -->

        <p>Since the irrigation method is the most productive and involves flooding the rice for most of the time, <a href="https://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/where-is-rice-grown">countries (like China and India) that use this method</a> would rank higher in both rice and methane production. While countries like <a href="https://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/where-is-rice-grown">Africa which mostly uses upland and lowland methods</a>, would produces less rice and methane.
        <br>
        With the global population increasing, the global rice consumption would surely increase as well. Sustainable methods of rice production must be implemented to protect the environment. In 2019, the Chinese government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded the <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/02/c_137944249.htm">Green Super Rice (GSR) project</a>, which aims to create rice varieties that can grow in the harsh environment, therefore increasing rice production in countries that uses the rainfed lowland and upland methods.
